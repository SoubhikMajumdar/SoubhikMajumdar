# Hi there, I'm Soubhik 👋

I'm passionate about computer vision and deep learning, with a focus on Autonomous Driving Systems and 3D perception.

##  What I'm Working On

- **3D Object Detection** using LiDAR and camera fusion
- **3D LiDAR Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Perception** for autonomous driving
- **SLAM & Visual Odometry** for robotics applications
- **3D reconstruction** using SfM-MVS; NeRF & Gaussian Splatting

##  Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python | C++ | MATLAB  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch | Scikit-learn | TensorFlow | OpenCV | YOLO | MMDetection3D | ROS
